# GPS-Tracker-Wearable
 Real time tracking wearable with Adafruitâ€™s FLORA and FONA with a built in GPS module. 
 
 The proposed system based on Adafruit FLORA V3 and FONA 3G is an effective, portable and low-power consumption live tracking wearable device. This system is designed to be compact and can be used as a standalone wearable or embedded in other wearable devices. The primary goal for this wearble is a power-efficient continuous GPS sensing wearable. Through the evaluation, it is observed that this system can provide several hours of continuous GPS tracking without any interruption.
